# GD-Timeline
GDHub Timeline is a website documenting the history of the game Geometry Dash. The website is a part of
the GDHub franchise, which is a community-driven project that aims to provide resources and information
to the Geometry Dash community.

The main feature of the website is a timeline that visualizes the major events and updates that have
happened in the game's history. The timeline is the result of the work of multiple contributors, who
have researched and compiled information on the game's development and community activities.

The website also contains articles that provide in-depth coverage of significant events in the game's
history, as well as guides and resources for players of the game. All content on the website is created
and maintained by members of the GDHub community.

If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions for the website, please feel free to contact us
through the GDHub Discord server or email.

Thank you for visiting the GDHub Timeline!
